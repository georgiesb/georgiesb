                    it follows an Englishwoman who travels to the American West

                    of her son. It premiered in the United Kingdom on BBC Two 
                    and iPlayer on 10 November 2022, and in the United States

                <p>
                    Englishwoman Lady Cornelia Locke comes to the West in 1890 
                    looking for revenge on the man she sees as responsible for 
                    the death of her son. She meets Eli Whipp, ex-cavalry scout 
                    and member of the Pawnee Nation by birth. Eli is on his way 
                    to Nebraska to claim the land he is owed for his service in 
                    the US army, despite having been told that the white men 
                    will not honour their debt. Cornelia and Eli discover a 
                    possible shared history.<sup>[2]</sup>

                    The review aggregator website Rotten Tomatoes reports an 
                    82% approval rating and an average rating of 7.7/10, based 
                    on 56 reviews. The website's consensus reads: "A visual 
                    knockout elevated by Emily Blunt and Chaske Spencer's 
                    performances, The English is a heady and somewhat 
                    meandering Western made with admirable craft."
                    <sup>[10]</sup> On Metacritic, it has a weighted average 
                    score of 74 out of 100 based on 26 critics, indicating 
                    "generally favorable reviews".<sup>[11]</sup> The Guardian 
                    gave it five out of five, stating: "although you might lose 
                    track of the details, the plot never becomes impenetrable 
                    or the performances less than compelling" citing Spencer 
                    and Blunt's performances as “a revelation”.<sup>[12]</sup>
