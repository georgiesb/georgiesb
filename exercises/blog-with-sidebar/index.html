                    Self-care has been defined as the process of establishing 
                    behaviors to ensure holistic well-being of oneself, to 
                    promote health.

                <p>
                    Having an effective self-care routine has been shown to 
                    have a number of important health benefits. Some of these 
                    include:
                </p>
                <ul>
                    <li>Reducing anxiety and depression</li>
                    <li>Reducing stress and improving resilience</li>
                    <li>Improving happiness</li>
                    <li>Increasing energy</li>
                    <li>Reducing burnout</li>
                    <li>Stronger interpersonal relationships</li>
                </ul>
                <p>
                    Specific forms of self-care have also been linked to 
                    different health and wellness benefits, including a 
                    longer life. Exercise, finding a sense of purpose in life, 
                    and sleep have all been connected to an increased lifespan.

                <p>
                    An effective self-care plan should be tailored to your life 
                    and your needs. It needs to be something created by you, 
                    for you. Customizing your own self-care plan can act as a 
                    preventative measure to make sure that you don't get 
                    overwhelmed, overstressed, and burned out. 
                </p>
                <ol>
                    <li>Assess your needs</li>
                    <li>Devise self-care strategies</li>
                    <li>Take small steps</li>
                    <li>Schedule time to focus on your needs</li>
                </ol>
                <p>
                    Self-care isn't a one-size-fits-all strategy. Your 
                    self-care plan will need to be customized to your needs 
                    and what is currently going on in your life. You don't 
                    want to wait until you've reached your breaking point. 
                    The goal is to take steps each day to make sure that you 
                    are getting what you need to deal with the stress and 
                    challenges you face in your daily life.
